// PART ONE - COMPLETED
// From scratch, initialize the React app
// Render an <App /> component
// Create the <App /> component from scratch
// Have the <App /> component render 3 or 4 checkboxes with paragraphs or spans next to it
// like you're making a todo list with some hard-codes items on it

// PART TWO - IN PROGRESS
// 1. Change the input/p combo to be a new component called <TodoItem />.
// For now, this new component will just have the same code as what it is in the App component
// 2. Style the page

import React from 'react';
